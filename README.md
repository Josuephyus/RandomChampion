Has every champion and selects a random one.

Don't know how to compress to a .exe from java but will learn.

# HOW IT WORKS
It reads from the thisList.txt to get the champion name and title (separated by ", "). Afterward, it finds the icon of the champion and all three to make a panel. This panel is then placed based on the Y Position (Double). Scrolling up or down increases or decreases the Y Position. Pressing Space Rolls it Randomly.

# Fonts
Font downloads are in the Font Packs. They are just stylistic and (if i learn to package) will come with the .exe.

# Caution
Be Careful. It only allows 5,000 characters in a text document and a minimum of 19 entries. The title is not necessary and can be omitted.
I'll update it when the new champions come out, but as of this patch Aurora is not out so good enough.
